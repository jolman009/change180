Children experience big emotions, and they need our help learning how to navigate them. As a parent and educator with over 17 years of experience, I've seen how powerful it is when parents become their child's emotional coach.

## Why Emotional Health Matters

Emotional health isn't just about feeling happy—it's about developing the skills to:
- Recognize and name feelings
- Cope with difficult emotions
- Build healthy relationships
- Bounce back from setbacks

## 5 Strategies for Supporting Your Child

### 1. Validate Their Feelings

When your child is upset, resist the urge to immediately fix or minimize. Instead, try:

**Instead of:** "You're fine, it's not a big deal."
**Try:** "I can see you're really upset. That must be hard."

Validation doesn't mean agreeing with their behavior—it means acknowledging their emotional experience.

### 2. Create a Feelings Vocabulary

Help your child expand beyond "mad" and "sad" by introducing words like:
- Frustrated
- Disappointed
- Worried
- Overwhelmed
- Jealous
- Excited

Use books, games, and daily conversations to build this vocabulary.

### 3. Model Emotional Regulation

Children learn by watching us. Let them see you:
- Take deep breaths when stressed
- Name your own emotions ("I'm feeling frustrated right now")
- Use healthy coping strategies
- Apologize when you make mistakes

### 4. Create Safe Spaces for Expression

Designate times and places where your child can express freely:
- A "calm down corner" with comfort items
- Regular one-on-one time without distractions
- Bedtime conversations about their day
- Art or journaling for older children

### 5. Teach Problem-Solving Skills

When emotions are calm, help your child think through challenges:
1. What happened?
2. How did it make you feel?
3. What could you do differently next time?
4. What do you need right now?

## A Note for Parents

Supporting your child's emotional health doesn't mean you need to be perfect. It means showing up, being present, and learning alongside them.

If you're feeling overwhelmed by parenting challenges, you don't have to navigate this alone. Parent coaching can provide you with tools, strategies, and support tailored to your family's unique needs.

*Growth is possible at any stage of life—for both you and your child.*
