There's a reason I named my coaching practice "change180." A 180-degree turn means facing a completely new direction—leaving behind what was and stepping into what could be.

## Why Change Feels So Hard

Our brains are wired for safety, and safety often means staying with what's familiar. Even when our current situation is painful, at least it's *known*. The unknown feels risky.

But here's the truth: **staying stuck has its own risks.** The risk of regret. The risk of never knowing what could have been. The risk of missing the life God is calling you toward.

## Signs You Might Be Ready for a Change

- You feel a persistent restlessness or dissatisfaction
- You keep thinking "there has to be more than this"
- You're exhausted from pretending everything is fine
- You have dreams you've been putting off "until someday"
- You feel disconnected from your purpose or values

## How to Begin Your 180

### 1. Acknowledge Where You Are

Transformation begins with honesty. You can't change what you won't acknowledge. Take time to really assess:
- What's working in my life?
- What's not working?
- What am I tolerating that I shouldn't be?

### 2. Get Clear on Where You Want to Go

Vision gives direction. Ask yourself:
- What would my life look like if I were thriving?
- What values do I want to live by?
- What legacy do I want to leave?

### 3. Take One Small Step

You don't need to change everything at once. Identify one small action you can take today. Maybe it's:
- Having a difficult conversation
- Setting a boundary
- Reaching out for help
- Starting a new habit

### 4. Surround Yourself with Support

Change is hard to do alone. Consider:
- Sharing your goals with a trusted friend
- Finding a mentor or coach
- Joining a supportive community
- Leaning into your faith community

## A Word of Encouragement

If you're standing at the edge of a new beginning, feeling scared and uncertain, I want you to know: **that's exactly where courage lives.**

Courage isn't the absence of fear—it's taking the next step anyway.

You don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to be willing to turn around and face a new direction. And you don't have to do it alone.

*The life you're longing for is waiting. Are you ready to take that first step?*
