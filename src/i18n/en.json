      "whatIsCoaching": {
        "question": "What is life coaching?",
        "answer": "Life coaching is a collaborative partnership that helps you identify and achieve your personal and professional goals. Unlike therapy, which often focuses on healing past trauma, coaching is future-focused and action-oriented. I help you gain clarity, develop strategies, and take meaningful steps toward the life you want to live."
      },
      "coachingVsTherapy": {
        "question": "How is coaching different from therapy?",
        "answer": "Therapy typically addresses mental health diagnoses, past trauma, and emotional healing. Coaching focuses on personal growth, goal achievement, and moving forward. While therapy asks 'why did this happen?', coaching asks 'where do you want to go?' Coaching is educational and supportive, not clinical. If you need mental health treatment, I can help connect you with appropriate resources."
      },
      "faithBased": {
        "question": "Do I need to be religious to work with you?",
        "answer": "Not at all. While my coaching is faith-centered and I draw from Christian principles, I welcome clients of all backgrounds. I respect your beliefs and will tailor our sessions to honor your values. My approach is faith-centered, not faith-pressured — you'll never feel judged or uncomfortable."
      },
      "sessionLength": {
        "question": "How long are coaching sessions?",
        "answer": "Individual sessions are 60 minutes. This gives us enough time to dive deep into your goals, reflect on progress, and create actionable next steps. Family and group sessions may vary in length depending on the needs of the participants."
      },
      "virtualOrInPerson": {
        "question": "Are sessions virtual or in-person?",
        "answer": "Both! I offer virtual sessions via secure video conferencing, which works great for busy schedules and clients outside my local area. In-person sessions are also available for those who prefer face-to-face connection. We'll find what works best for you."
